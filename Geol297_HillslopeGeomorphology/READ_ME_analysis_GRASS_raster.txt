1. Save files under the following structure.

\folder\analysis_GRASS_raster.py

\folder\location1
\folder\location1\elev
\folder\location1\grad
...
\folder\location1\basins

\folder\location2
\folder\location2\elev
\folder\location2\grad
...
\folder\location2\basins

\folder\location3
\folder\location3\elev
\folder\location3\grad
...
\folder\location3\basins	

The "analysis_GRASS_raster.py" assumes all files are generated by the GRASS ascii grid export. 

2. In the landlab conda environment, run Spyder (preferably) or IDLE , and open analysis_GRASS_raster.py
-line 46: Make sure the filenames in your folders correspond to the items in "maptypes"
-line50: Rename items in "loc_name_list" to reflect the names of your 3 study areas. Make sure these are in the same order as the  corresponding folder names (loc_list, line 49)
-lines 113 and 140: Make sure to comment OUT "plt.close('all')". 

3. PLOTTING MAPS (line 59)
This produces figures corresponding to items in "which_map" [line 62], which are indices corresponding to items in "maptypes" [line 46] 
Each figure has subplots corresponding to "which_loc" [line 60], which are indices corresponding to your study areas, "loc_name_list" [line 50]  
For each study area, you have the option of plotting the whole map, or just a chosen basin. Set corresponding indices in " which_area" [line 62] to -1 to plot the whole area, or to the basin number to plot just the basin. Number of indices in "which_loc 

4. Running #3 PLOTTING HISTOGRAMS (line 59)
This produces figures corresponding to items in "which_map" [line 109], which are indices corresponding to items in "maptypes" [line 46] 
Each figure has subplots corresponding to "which_loc" [line 108], which are indices corresponding to your study areas, "loc_name_list" [line 50]  
For each study area, you have the option of plotting the whole map, or just a chosen basin. Set corresponding indices in " which_area" [line 110] to -1 to plot the whole area, or to the basin number to plot just the basin. Number of indices in "which_loc
You may adjust the number of histogram bins "nhistbins" [line 111] later to improve your histograms.

5. Running #4 PLOTTING SCATTERPLOTS (line 59)
This produces figures corresponding to items in "which_mapX","which_mapY","which_mapZ" [lines 133-135], which contain indices corresponding to items in "maptypes" [line 46], and corresponding to the elements of the scatterplot.
 "which_mapX" corresponds to data plotted along the x-axis; "which_mapY" to data plotted along the y-axis; and "which_mapZ" to the color scheme of the plot points. They must all have the same number of indices. These correspond to the scatterplot's data in x and
Each figure has subplots corresponding to "which_loc" [line 132], which are indices corresponding to your study areas, "loc_name_list" [line 50]  
For each study area, you have the option of plotting the whole map, or just a chosen basin. Set corresponding indices in " which_area" [line 136] to -1 to plot the whole area, or to the basin number to plot just the basin. Number of indices in "which_loc

6. TIPS in running the whole module (in spyder):
-After one complete run of the program  "analysis_GRASS_raster.py", you can now skip the reading of input files [lines 51 to 57], if you want to re-edit and re-run specific parts (plot maps, histograms, scatterplots) as needed. 
-lines 64, 113 and 140: Make sure to uncomment  "plt.close('all')". This will close previous figures when re-running the program or part/s of the program.  
-Edit the specific specific part (e.g., plotting maps) that you want to run. Make sure to keep the cursor within that specific part. Then click Ctrl+Enter (Run current cell)
